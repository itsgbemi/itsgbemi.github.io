      <p>I don't believe anyone should try to save this country.</p>
      <p>Not because I am unaffected by the bad governance, but because the problems run much deeper than that. On the rare occasions I engage in social interactions, it’s only a matter of time before the conversation shifts to topics like women, sexuality, or identity, and a familiar wave of discomfort washes over me. The rot in this country isn’t limited to those in power; it’s in almost everyone. Of course, someone who opposes free will or the idea of respecting people’s choices might view my acceptance of atheism, queerness, and other differences as "rot" as well.</p>
      <p>But at the core, I know that respecting people, regardless of their differences, is the right thing to do. It’s wrong to impose your beliefs or morals as a standard for others. As long as someone’s lifestyle isn’t harming others, being hostile toward their differences is irrational. Projection is the most distorted lens, yet it always seems clear to the one wearing it.</p>
      <p>I find it ironic when people who abandon religion often turn around and ridicule those who remain in its structured belief system. I think people should hold onto whatever belief helps them make sense of the world. The mystery of our existence is profound, and whether you explain it through religion, science, or nothing at all, it’s all valid.</p>
      <p>I believe it's unkind and ultimately pointless to try to shake someone's belief system. People change when they're ready, not because someone insists they should. Change is deeply personal, and it’s cruel to destabilize someone’s faith. While I have many reservations about religious principles that promote the condescension of others, I also recognize how religion provides hope and stability for many.</p>
      
      <p>As a nation, I fear we are heading toward self-destruction. While I might not live to see it, I don’t rule out the possibility. The supremacist mindset in Nigeria—whether based on gender, age, tribe, or wealth—will be part of our downfall. Believing you're superior because of these things breeds decay. This isn’t to say there aren't people better than others in certain ways—there are. But when this obsession with superiority leads to bullying and abuse, it becomes destructive. That is the real rot.</p>

<p>If you have a messiah complex and believe you can change Nigeria, here are a first few steps you may want to take:</p>
    
    <ol class="content-list">
      <li>Choose the first set of problems you want to tackle.</li>
      <li>Be prepared to do a lot of work.</li>
      <li>Find or connect with like-minded people.</li>
      <li>Expect pushback.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>If you ask me, tackling poverty and illiteracy should be among the first priorities. Both issues have been weaponized on a large scale. People are more open to change when they are in a better place—mentally, psychologically, financially, and in other aspects of life.</p>
    
    <p>Good luck. In the end, it's the bold and crazy ones who will save Nigeria.</p>
