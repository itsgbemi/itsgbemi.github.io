    <!-- Content Paragraph -->
    <section class="content-paragraph">
  <p>The art of selling, whether online or offline, boils down to understanding the psychology of your customer and crafting a strategy that speaks to their needs and desires. As a customer, you’re usually driven by one of two forces: necessity or desire. Sometimes, you already know what you need; other times, you’re influenced by content that ignites a desire for a product or service. Once you’ve set your mind on a purchase, you begin comparing vendors to ensure you're spending your money with the provider that offers the best value. This comparison typically includes looking at customer reviews, evaluating pricing, and checking for any affirmations of quality from previous buyers.</p>

<p>If your desire to buy came from content that sparked your interest, then much of the decision-making process is already complete. Your mind has been influenced by the brand's image, and now it’s a matter of fine-tuning your choice. For sellers, especially new ones entering a competitive space, this highlights the importance of standing out. Competing with established players who already have a loyal following means you have to go beyond just offering a standard product. You need to do more, or at least do something different.</p>

<p>This could mean adding value in ways your competitors don’t. For instance, offering larger portions, special discounts, free delivery, or creating content that goes viral by tapping into current trends can help your business stand out. However, no matter how you choose to compete, the first step is always to have a solid plan. Your plan should involve studying the market—seeing what others are doing and figuring out what you bring to the table that others don’t.</p>

<p>Take, for example, a food business selling a plate of jollof rice for 3,500 NGN in Ibadan, Nigeria. If you're just starting out and your competitors are also selling at the same price, but they have bigger followings, customers will likely choose them over you. However, if you create an offer—say, an extra portion, a free drink, or a flat fee for deliveries or regular orders—you immediately elevate your offering. Now, it’s no longer just about the price; it’s about the value you're providing.</p>

<p>But value alone isn’t enough. In today’s digital age, showing quality through content is essential. A good deal might attract attention, but if you want to create a long-term relationship with your customers—one that doesn’t rely on constant promotions—you need to communicate your quality assurance effectively.</p>

<p>Let’s explore the journey of a potential customer on Instagram, scrolling through their feed. Chances are, they’ve been engaging with food-related content like recipes or how-to videos. Maybe they’ve even interacted with trending content featuring food businesses. As they scroll, your campaign pops up—either as sponsored content or as a suggested post.</p>

<p>Now that your content has caught their eye, your goal is to keep them engaged. Even if they don’t make an immediate purchase or follow your account, you want to leave a lasting impression. Social media algorithms are designed to show users more of the content they’ve engaged with, so if they linger on your page, watch your videos, or like a post, there’s a good chance they’ll see your content again.</p>

<p>This is where optimizing your Instagram page becomes critical. You want to create a page that speaks directly to foodies, with content that is visually appealing and easy to navigate. Make sure your IG highlights are customer-facing, offering clear information about your business, and pin your top three posts so that they immediately showcase the best of what you have to offer. An aesthetically pleasing content layout will also play a huge role in capturing their interest.</p>

<p>In essence, selling is both an art and a science. It’s about understanding the customer journey and ensuring that at every step, from first impression to final purchase, you are meeting—and exceeding—their expectations.</p>
